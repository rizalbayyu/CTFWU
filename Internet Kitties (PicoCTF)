I was told there was something at IP shell2017.picoctf.com with port 58626. How do I get there? Do I need a ship for the port?

Hint:
- Look at using the netcat (nc) command!
- To figure out how to use it, you can run "man nc" or "nc -h" on the shell, or search for it on the interwebz

Solution:
Cek cara menggunkan nc pada terminal
Jika sudah maka coba nc shell2017.picoctf.com 58626
Maka akan mendapatkan: 
Yay! You made it!                                          
Take a flag!
